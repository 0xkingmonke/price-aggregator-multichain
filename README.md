This project serves 2 purpose - it is a cryptocurrecny price aggregator and NFT analysis tool.

Project's name is Pachinko which is a Japanese form of pinball. The pinball is similar to this project,  you wage your money and hope that the pinball hits as many points before it comes back to you : the point is a metaphor for another cryptocurrnecy that you are trying to swap.

There is many different blockchain that is built ontop of Ethereum's virtual machine's code, trading liquidity is spread across different blockchain. The price aggregator tackle this issue directly by displaying the best blockchain to swap your cryptocurrency.
The NFT (Non-fungible token) dashboard has 2 features. First, there is a table where it displays NFT projects and it's stats. Second, it allows users to look up the project's stats on opensea and search for any particular asset (with the token ID ).


As an avid user of cryptocurrency products, I feel that this crypto space can feel like a dark forest. Decentralized financial products on the blockchain can be intimidating to use, the purpose of this project is to help new users onboard and simplify the process of learning. 



There are many smart contract blockchain that is built ontop of EVM (Ethereum virtual machine). The assets on different blockchain can be transfer to and fro each other. There is many different trading platform on different blockchain, Pachinko finds the best blockchain to swap assets on.
There is a recent trend of trading art pieces on the blockchain - NFT(Non-fungible token). There isn't an easy way to do a lookup of the NFT based on it's token ID. Pachinko serves as an easy way to do a look up on ID and show the trade stats of the token on opensea.
